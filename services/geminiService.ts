    Please act as a legal and policy research assistant. Your task is to find and summarize local ordinances and regulations specifically related to the development and siting of solar farms (also known as solar energy systems or photovoltaic facilities) for the following location: "${location}".

    Focus exclusively on regulations that apply to utility-scale or large commercial solar projects, not small residential rooftop installations.

    For each distinct ordinance or regulation you find, provide the following information in the specified JSON format:
    - The official title of the ordinance.
    - The jurisdiction it applies to (e.g., city, county).
    - A summary of its key provisions regarding solar farms.
    - A bulleted list of key points, including details on zoning requirements, setback distances from property lines and roads, height restrictions, screening/landscaping rules, and any requirements for decommissioning plans.
    - A direct, valid, and publicly accessible URL to the official government source document if one can be located. If not available, provide null for the source_url.

    If you cannot find specific "solar farm" ordinances, look for sections within broader zoning codes that address renewable energy facilities. If no relevant information can be found, return an empty list.
